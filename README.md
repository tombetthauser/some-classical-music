# Some Classical Music

Personal inks and basic information on some classical music I can actually listen to. Mainly to play for my kid without boring me to death. My wife calls it Hannibal Lectermusic. She's correct.

## Mozart Piano Sonatas

According to Wikipedia Sonatas is a vague term. I agree. But fonctionally it seems to distinguish between a piece of music that's meant to be played on an instrument rather than sung. As in sung in an opera I assume. Which I can't stand. Maybe someday. I'm not sure that would be good for a kid's brain anyway.

Mozart is obviosly a household name and the movie is more fun than reading the Wikipedia article but apparantly he was a "prolific" and "influential" composer of the "Classical Period". Interestingly (or randomly) the Classical Period refers to European culture (just music? not sure) after the Boroque period but before the Romantic period from EXACTLY 1750 to 1820 CE. Other Classical Era music people include Hayden, Beethoven and Schubert (they both count as Romantic too), Salieri (from the movie) and others who are not as recognizable from TV, movies and dubstep remixes.

The Boroque period is often remembered by the super gross over-the-top and / or funny paintings of rich people tickling eachother in gardens exemplified best by [this guy](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=jean+honore+fragonard&t=ffab&iar=images&iax=images&ia=images). Boroque music apparantly includes Bach and Vivaldi which is cool I guess. The Romantic Period was all about super intense emotions and nature and sublime sunset clouds etc. Beethoven and Chopin and Schubert and Schumann and Brahms and Tchaikovsky and Wagner and Mahler and Strauss and Verdi and Puccini and Rachmaninoff all did their thing in the Romantic era. Since those all seemed more or less like household-ish names it seems like modern humans listen to a lot more romantic classical music than anything else. Maybe?

Anyway Mozart died when he was 35 which is crazy but he made a ton of work in a ton of different genres, most of which I can't really listen too. He was born in Germany when Germany was still part of the Holy Roman Empire, which was some kind of post-Roman Empire Christian cover band. He got famous when he was a little kid, ran away from home sort of at some point and remained super famous but super poor in Vienna until he died of some random illness. He got buried with poor people because he spent all his money living it up. He was a party animal.

His piano sonatas are the main thing I can stand listening too I think because they're simple. Just one regular piano, no singing, no harpsichord etc.

My favorite recordings of these are by [Lili Kraus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lili_Kraus) from the 1950's. She was a pianist from Budapest who specialized in Mozart and Beethoven. In the 1940's she was touring in Asia and she was captured and interned in a Japanese concentration camp for two years along with her family. After the war she bounced to New Zealand then Texas then North Carolina where she died in 1986. 

Lili Kraus seems pretty cool and her recordings have some nice grit to them on a few different levels.
